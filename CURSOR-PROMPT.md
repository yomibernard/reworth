# CURSOR-PROMPT.md — ReWorth MVP Journey (Prompts 1–11)

> **How to use:** Execute **one phase instruction at a time**. Do not implement future phases in the same PR. Full acceptance criteria for each phase are summarized below; expand from `PRD.md` when implementing. After launch, continue with [`CURSOR-PROMPT-PHASE2-3.md`](CURSOR-PROMPT-PHASE2-3.md).

## Conflict rule

| Concern | Source of truth |
| --- | --- |
| Product decisions (scope, UX, acceptance, ambition) | [`PRD.md`](PRD.md) (60 sections) |
| Engineering decisions & build order | **This brief** (`CURSOR-PROMPT.md`) |

If this brief and the PRD conflict: **product follows the PRD; engineering and sequencing follow this brief.**

## Master brief overview

You are the complete full-stack development team for **ReWorth**, a consumer recommerce marketplace (**buy · sell · swap · give away**) launching in Lagos, Nigeria — Lekki, Ikoyi, Victoria Island, Oniru, VGC, Chevron, Ajah and surrounding communities.

- First-time user photographs an item and has it **live in ~60 seconds** with AI assistance.
- Long-term ambition: Nigeria's leading recommerce ecosystem.
- Brand tagline: *"Lagos, your unused things are worth something."*
- Authoritative product spec: `PRD.md` — read fully before writing code.

### 14-role team

| Role | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| Product Owner | Scope, acceptance criteria, Definition-of-Done sign-off, phase reports |
| Solution Architect | System design, ADRs (`docs/ADRS/`), phase plans, module boundaries |
| Backend Lead (NestJS) | API, domain services, state machines, jobs, tests |
| Frontend Engineer (Next.js) | Web storefront, PDP, discovery surfaces |
| Mobile Engineer (React Native/Expo) | iOS + Android, camera, push, offline resilience |
| Database Engineer | PostgreSQL schema, migrations, indexes, OpenSearch mappings, seed |
| AI/ML Engineer | Photo→listing, price intel, NL search, content scanning |
| Payments Engineer | PSP, escrow state machine, webhooks, idempotency, refunds, payouts |
| DevOps / Platform | Docker, CI/CD, environments, secrets, observability, load tests |
| QA Lead | Test strategy, automated suites, golden-path e2e, UAT |
| Security Engineer | PRD §44–45 controls, per-phase threat review, hardening |

| Data Analyst | KPI events (PRD §36), dashboard SQL, metric definitions |
| Ops / Support Lead | Admin workflows, moderation queues, support tickets, runbooks |

### Working agreements

1. **One phase at a time.** Plan → implement → update `AGENTS.md` + `docs/PHASE_STATUS.md`.
2. Work is done only per **Definition of Done** (PRD §59).
3. One branch + one PR per phase. Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `test:`, `docs:`).
4. Never invent credentials — placeholders in `.env.example` only.
5. Every external service = **interface + prod adapter + deterministic mock**.
6. Uncovered decisions → smallest reasonable choice + ADR; **≤3 open questions** per phase.

### Baked-in stack (no substitutions without ADR)

| Area | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Monorepo | Turborepo + pnpm |
| Mobile | React Native + Expo (iOS + Android) |
| Web + Admin | Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind |
| API | NestJS modular monolith, REST `/api/v1` |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 + Prisma; Redis + BullMQ |
| Media | S3-compatible (MinIO in dev), presigned uploads |
| Search | OpenSearch + Postgres FTS fallback adapter |
| Auth | JWT (short access + rotating refresh), phone OTP, Google/Apple OAuth |
| SMS | Termii or Twilio + console mock |
| Payments | Paystack + mock PSP; escrow-shaped (ADR-002 / PRD §17) |
| AI | Multimodal LLM (OpenAI GPT-4o default) + rule-based mock |
| Locale | NGN, en-NG, WAT |

### Definition of Done (PRD §59)

A feature is done only when: functional requirements pass · UX approved · responsive · security review · analytics events · error/loading/empty states · accessibility · automated tests pass · documentation updated · Product Owner acceptance.

## Appendix — Quick Resume Cheat Sheet

If a phase stalls or context runs out, paste exactly:

```
Continue: resume Phase N from docs/PHASE_STATUS.md. Re-read AGENTS.md and
PRD.md, verify the last commit's tests still pass, then continue the plan. Do not restart completed work.
```

**Phase tags:** `v0.0-scaffold` · `v0.1-auth` · `v0.2-listings` · `v0.3-discovery` · `v0.4-chat-offers` · `v0.5-orders-payments` · `v0.6-logistics-notifications` · `v0.7-trust` · `v0.8-admin` · `v0.9-risk-security` · `v0.9.0-rc`

**After launch:** full post-MVP series in [`CURSOR-PROMPT-PHASE2-3.md`](CURSOR-PROMPT-PHASE2-3.md) — tags `v1.0` → `v2.1` with an **entry gate** confirming MVP stability before any 2.x work.
