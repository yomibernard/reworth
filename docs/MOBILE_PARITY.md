# Mobile parity audit

> **Doctrine:** ReWorth is mobile-first. Primary surface = iOS + Android (`apps/mobile`). Web = companion. Admin = out of scope.  
> **Statuses:** `full` · `partial` · `missing`  
> **Audited:** 2026-09-16 · Post adoption P0–P11 (B2B mobile)  
> **Owners:** Mobile Lead + Product · update when shipping consumer surfaces

## Legend

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **full** | Comparable user journey on mobile and web |
| **partial** | Mobile has a subset, lib-only, badge-only, or simplified modal vs full web page |
| **missing** | User-facing on web; no (or non-wired) mobile UI |

Companion column notes web’s intended role when mobile is primary.

## Companion web (intended thin)

These are **expected** on web even when mobile leads; keep parity **full** or document intentional web-only deep links:

| Flow | Mobile | Web | Intent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shareable listing URLs | deep link TBD | **full** | Web companion for links |
| SEO / marketing landing | N/A | **full** | Web-only OK |
| Admin ops | N/A | Admin app | Out of scope |

---

## Summary counts (consumer flows above)

| | full | partial | missing |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Mobile | ~28 | ~6 | ~6 |

Exact rows: see tables. **Priority close order (mobile-first):** Maestro ≤60s device recording; staging k6; Termii keys.

---

## Process

1. New consumer feature: ship mobile → update this file → web parity in-phase or add to `AGENTS.md` Known gaps.  
2. Do not mark a phase Done while mobile is **missing** unless Product explicitly defers into Known gaps.  
3. Admin never appears in this matrix.
