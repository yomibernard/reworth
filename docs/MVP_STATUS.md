## Top 5 risks to launch

1. **Staging load not proven** — local k6 cannot certify p95 &lt; 500ms at 500 VUs (`docs/PERF.md`).  
2. **Push is mock** — buyers may miss time-critical alerts without FCM/APNs.  
3. **PSP go-live** — webhook/HMAC misconfig blocks escrow.  
4. **SMS provider balance / deliverability** — OTP is the auth spine.  
5. **External pen-test + NDPR counsel unfinished** — legal/security gate.

## External sign-offs still required

- Penetration test sign-off  
- NDPR / privacy counsel review  
- PSP merchant licensing / live key approval  
- App Store & Play Store review  
- Staging performance sign-off (k6)
